# Due Diligence Report: Auto Image Generation Feature

## 1. Requirements Verification

I have re-read the `agents.md` file and verified that all requirements have been met.

- **Conditional Settings UI:** The new settings are added to the "Advanced" section and are only visible when "Generation Mode" is 'separate' and "Use model connected to RPG Companion Trackers preset" is checked.
- **Functionality (Separate Mode Only):** The prompt is modified to include the image generation instructions, the response is parsed to extract the image prompt, and the `/sd` command is triggered.
- **Image Insertion:** Both "Create New Message" and "Insert Inline (Last Message)" options are implemented.
- **Verbatim Code:** Existing code has been preserved, and changes are documented in `changes.md`.
- **Preserve Functionality:** The existing tracker functionality is not affected by the new feature.

## 2. Code Review

I have reviewed all the modified files to ensure the code is clean, efficient, and follows the existing coding style.

- **`src/core/state.js`**: The new settings are correctly added to the `extensionSettings` object with appropriate default values.
- **`template.html`**: The new HTML is well-structured and follows the existing layout.
- **`index.js`**: The UI logic is correctly implemented, and event listeners are properly bound.
- **`src/systems/generation/promptBuilder.js`**: The prompt modification logic is correct and only applies when the feature is enabled.
- **`src/systems/generation/apiClient.js`**: The response parsing and image generation logic are correctly implemented.

## 3. Final Conclusion

All requirements have been met, and the code has been reviewed. The new auto image generation feature is ready for testing.
